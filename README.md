# Minetest World - Rock Scissors Paper Lizard Spock

Built using mesecons!


## Description

Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock is a five-gesture expansion of the classic selection method game rock-paper-scissors. It operates on the same basic principle, but includes two additional weapons: the lizard (formed by the hand as a sock-puppet-like mouth) and Spock (formed by the Star Trek Vulcan salute). This reduces the chances of a round ending in a tie. 


## Rules

The rules of Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock are:

* Scissors cuts paper
* Paper covers rock
* Rock crushes lizard
* Lizard poisons Spock
* Spock smashes scissors
* Scissors decapitates lizard
* Lizard eats paper
* Paper disproves Spock
* Spock vaporizes rock
* Rock crushes scissors

There are ten possible pairings of the five gestures; each gesture beats two of the other gestures and is beaten by the remaining two.
